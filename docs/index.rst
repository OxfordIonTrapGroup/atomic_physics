Atomic Physics
==============

``atomic_physics`` is a lightweight python library for calculations based on atomic
structure. Its functionality includes:

* accurate atomic structure data for a number of common atom / ion species
* calculating state energies
* electric and magnetic interaction matrix elements and Rabi frequencies
* rate equations simulations

Overview
========

The main source of documentation is the :ref:`api` reference, which has documentation for
all classes in ``atomic_physics``.

``atomic_physics`` aims to provide extensive, user-friendly documentation. If you can't
easily find the information you need to use it, or if it's not obvious how functions
work / what conventions and definitions are used, we consider that a bug so please
open an issue!
